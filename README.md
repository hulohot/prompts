- `circuit-design-prompts`: contains prompts related to electrical engineering, such as circuit design, microcontrollers, and embedded systems.
- `business-prompts`: contains prompts related to entrepreneurship and business, such as marketing, strategy, and finance.

Each folder may have subfolders to further organize the prompts.
